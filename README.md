How Far From Home? A SwiftUI App to find out how far you can travel from home and where you can 'socially distanced' meet your friends.

It's a project I put together to learn SwiftUI, It's by no means good code yet, I just wanted to understand how this all worked.

## Things I'd like to do!
ðŸ‘‰ Persistance of your location
ðŸ‘‰ Naming and persistance of alternative locations
ðŸ‘‰ Better handling of users current location
ðŸ‘‰ Local alerts if you leave your area
